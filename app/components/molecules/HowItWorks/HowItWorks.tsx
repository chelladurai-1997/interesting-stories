          1. Sending Interest
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          You can send interest to other users you're interested in. If they
          haven't previously declined your request, the interest will be sent
          successfully.
        </p>

        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          When a user receives your interest, they can either accept or decline
          it. If accepted, both of you will have established a mutual interest
          and can move forward.

        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          After mutual interest is established, sharing contact details is
          optional. During registration, you can choose to share contact info
          right away or keep it private until you're ready.

        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-2">
          Once mutual interest is established, the chat feature will be enabled.
          You can now message each other directly on the platform to get to know
          one another better before deciding to share contact details.

          If someone declines your interest, you wonâ€™t be able to send another.
          However, they can still reconsider and change their decision to accept
          your interest at any point of time, even after declining it.
